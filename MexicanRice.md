INGREDIENTS
1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
1 medium onion, peeled and coarsely chopped
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2/3 cup neutral cooking oil, such as canola or safflower (or rendered lard)
4 cups long-grain white rice
2 to 4 medium jalapeño or serrano chile peppers, seeded and minced (optional)
8 to 10 cloves garlic, finely chopped, basically a garlic bunch
1/2 cup finely fresh cilantro
Juice of 4 medium limes, plus more wedges for serving.  True Lime (tm) powder works well too.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Place the tomatoes and their juices and onion in a blender or food processor and purée until smooth.
2. Stir in the chicken broth, salt, and cumin and bring to a boil over medium heat.
3. In a second pot, toast the rice...
    - Heat the oil in a Dutch oven (or any deep pot) over medium heat until shimmering.
    - Add the rice and sauté, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted and golden, about 5 minutes.
    - Add the chopped garlic to the hot rice, and the jalapeños if including them.  Cook until the garlic begins to golden, which can be anywhere from 30 second to a few minutes.
4. Turn on your stovetop fan to be ready for the steam, and then bit by bit combine the boiling tomato mixture over the rice and stir to combine.  If you dump them together all at once you can get a big mess.
5. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.
6. Remove from the heat and gently fluff the rice with the fork. Cover again and set aside to steam for 10 minutes.
  
Add the cilantro and lime juice and fluff again to combine. Taste and season with more salt as needed. Serve with lime wedges.

Storage: Leftovers freeze and reheat nicely.  
Basmati rice also goes nicely instead of long grain.
