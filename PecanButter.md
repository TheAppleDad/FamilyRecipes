**Ingredients:**
This recipe requires a more powerful blender like a Vitamix blender.  The old Oster blender
was gone when this recipe was first tried.  It's unlikely that weaker blender could have 
made the pecan butter into a smooth consistency.

This recipe requires some time because it gets really hot while blending, and has to sit a 
while to cool down before blending can be finished.

 - 6 cups pecans
 - 6 Tbs Honey
 - 3 Tbs Manuka Honey
 - 1.5 tsp salt
 - 2 to 3 Tbs avocado oil

**Instructions:**
1. Line air fryer basket with aluminum foil and pour about 2 cups of pecans into the basket.
   Set air fryer to about 350 degrees and air fry for about 3 minutes to lightly toast the pecans.
   If they become at all blackened then they have been over-cooked.  Repeat until all pecans are toasted.
1. combine all ingredients into the blender.
1. Blend for a total of 10 minutes, stopping every 40 seconds or so to tamp down on the mixture and to force
   all portions to be blended evenly, and checking the mixture to make sure it's not getting too hot.  The
   nuts are probably still hot from being roasted, and have had to sit for a while after only about 3
   minutes of blending to cool down.  The sugar in the honey will also make the mixture stay hot a long
   time.
