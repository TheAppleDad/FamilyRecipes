Dad's Spaghetti Carbonara with Ham and Peas

2 small bags of frozen peas
1 to 2 lbs of cooked ham (not the sliced lunchmeat kind, but a solid ham) cut into about fingernail sized cubes
3 or 4 eggs
1 lb of uncooked spaghetti
1/2 lb (about) of thick cut bacon
a hunk of parmgiano reggiano cheese from which you will finely grate around 8 to 10 Tbs.  2 small bags of store bought pre-shredded parmesan cheese works too.
4 or 5 ish big cloves of garlic

1. prep the ingredients ...
	- cut the florets off the ends of the broccoli, break into about thumb sized pieces so 
	  they'll cook more easily when the time comes, and then set aside.
	- break the eggs into a small bowl and scramble them.  Set aside.
	- cube the ham into small bite-sized pieces
	- grate the parmigiano reggiano cheese if it wasn't pre-shredded
	- squize the garlic cloves to make them easy to peel, and then mince them
	
1. start heating some water for the pasta, adding some salt to the water.
1. You will use a pizza cutter in this step, so don't use a non-stick pan.
   Line the bottom of a wide, deep pan with bacon, and begin heating at medium on 
   the stove. 
   As the bacon begins to cook, run a pizza cutter back and forth to break the bacon into 
   small pieces, about a quarter inch or so across.
1. Once the bacon is browned, add the minced garlic and wait until it begins to turn golden.
1. add the ham and cook until it is beginning to brown, and then add all the peas to the mixture.  The volume of the peas and ham should be roughly similar.
   Cook for a few minutes until the peas are heated, and then turn off the heat and cover to keep mixture warm.
1. Start cooking the spaghetti until it's al-dente.
1. Once the spaghetti is cooked, first reserve a cup or two of the hot water before draining it from the noodles.  I use a ladle and a mug or a bowl.
1. Lift the lid off the bacon/ham/broccoli mixture and combine the spaghetti and grated parmesan into it.
1. Mixing the eggs is the tricky spot because the noodles are probably too hot for the eggs at this point.
   You want the mixture hot enough to sanitize the eggs, but not so hot you flash cook the eggs into a solid.
   Pour a small amount of the beaten eggs onto the mixture, and if they flash cook then wait a minute or two,
   stirring the mixture a few times to combine the cooling top part into the middle.   The reserve water can
   help keep the mixture loose if it starts to gum up together at this stage. Once you can start adding
   eggs into the top part of the mixture without flash cooking, spread them around the top before combining them througout the rest of the
   mixture.
1. A few minutes later the eggs are sanitized and it's ready to be served.
