Ingredients
 - 1 package noodles, at most 16 oz
 - 1 to 2 lbs ground beef
 - 1 jar cheeze whiz, 15oz
 - about 1/2 cup milk
 - 1 to 2 tsp onion powder
 - 1 or 2 tsp garlic salt
 - 1 can sweet kernel corn (optional), 15oz

1. Cook the ground beef in a medium skillet at a low to medium heat, stirring every few minutes
   to prevent burning.  Locate some small, probably expendable container to hold the beef fat when the cooking is done.  Cover while cooking to shorten the cooking time. If the ground beef was frozen, microwave for a few minutes to partially thaw before cooking in skillet and then expect to flip the frozen meat over a few times while cooking in the skillet to break up the browned and thawed portion away from the frozen portion.  Once done cooking, drain the fat.  It can be handy to hold the lid down with a mitt while tipping the pan over the grease container.  Once the beef is drained of fat, sprinkle the the garlic salt and onion powder over the beef, stirring to mix in.  Taste a sample to make sure you have applied enough spice.
 
1. Sprinkle a few shakes of salt into a pot of water, heat until boiling, and then add noodles.  Cook the amount of time according to the directions, which is usually 6 or 7 minutes for thinner noodles, or 11 minutes for thicker noodles.  Drain water.

1. Combine noodles, beef, cheeze whiz, milk, and corn in a large bowl.  Mix together, adding more milk if the cheese sauce is too thick.

   Tip about the noodles:  Once the water is drained, the steaming hot noodles are still cooking and can turn mushy if left to steam for a few more minutes.  Adding the other, cooler ingredients stops the cookign and will keep the noodles chewy.  If other ingredients are not ready yet to mix with the noodles to cool them down, then spray them with cool water and mix until they stop steaming.  It can be reheated later.
