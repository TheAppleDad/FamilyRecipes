Tex Mex Rice

A simple and not heavy dish of rice, beef, some corn, and stewed tomatoes.  

- 1 lb (about) of ground beef
- a few shakes of garlic salt and onion powder for the beef when it's done
- 1 package (10oz) frozen corn or 1 can (14.5oz) of corn
- 1 can (14.5 oz) stewed tomatoes
- 1/2 tsp oregano (I use powdered)
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/8 tsp black pepper

Rice: 
   - If using minute rice, use 1 1/2 cups, and have 1 cup water
   - If using an instant pot, put in 1 1/2 cups rice and 1 1/2 cups water, close the lid and press the "rice" button.

1. Brown meat, breaking the pieces up.  Drain out the fat.  I'll spread the beef out and sprinkle garlic salt and onion powder on it to taste.  This is just for the beef.
1. Add corn, tomatoes, and the other spices.  If using minute rice, add the cup of water, and you'll need to bring it to a boil.
1. Stir in the rice.  If using minute rice, remove from heat and cover for about 5 minutes.
