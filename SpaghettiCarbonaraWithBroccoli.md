Dad's Spaghetti Carbonara

2 Heads of Fresh Broccoli
1 lb (about) of cooked ham (not the sliced lunchmeat kind, but a solid ham)
3 eggs
1 lb of uncooked spaghetti
1/2 lb (about) of thick cut bacon
a hunk of parmgiano reggiano cheese from which you will finely grate around 8 to 10 Tbs
4 or 5 ish big cloves of garlic

1. prep the ingredients ...
	- cut the florets off the ends of the broccoli, break into about thumb sized pieces so 
	  they'll cook more easily when the time comes, and then set aside.
	- break the eggs into a small bowl and scramble them.  Set aside.
	- julienne cut the ham (cut it into strips), and then set aside.
	- grate the parmigiano reggiano cheese
	- mince the garlic cloves
	
2. start heating some water for the pasta, adding some salt to the water.
3. You will use a pizza cutter in this step, so don't use a non-stick pan.
   Line the bottom of a wide, deep pan with bacon, and beging heating at medium on 
   the stove. 
   As the bacon begins to cook, run a pizza cutter back and forth to break the bacon into 
   small pieces, about a quarter inch or so across.
4. Once the bacon is browned, add the ham and cook until it is beginning to brown.
5. Add the garlic and cook until the garlic starts to turn golden.
   Then throw in the broccoli, mix to coat the broccoli, turn off the heat and cover the 
   mixture with a lid.
6. Start cooking the spaghetti until it's al-dente.
7. Once the spaghetti is cooked, lift the lid off the bacon/ham/broccoli mixture and 
   scoop out the spaghetti into it.
   Add the grated cheese and then stir the mixture for a few moments.
   You will want to avoid putting the eggs right onto the boiling hot spaghetti, so it's
   important to mix it first with the other ingredients that were cooling while the 
   spaghetti cooked.
8. Add the eggs to the mixture and stir in thoroughly.
